# Airline-Reservation-System
Data Structures CS2413 Duo Project: Create an airline reservation system for Blueskies.  
Code must include a main.cpp, linked_list.h, linked_list.cpp, reservation.h, and reservations.cpp.  
There must be two classes: one for linked list and one for reservation.  

Simulation of Airline Reservation System

This Project stimulates an Airline Reservation System where customers can make a Reservation, cancel a Reservation,
Search for a Passenger, Change the Reservation seat, Change the Reservation food, list all Passengers, and produce reports.
This Program is written in C++ and uses Object Oriented Programming concepts to manage the Passengers and Reservations.

**How to use the Program***

To run the program, you must run the following command in the terminal or the command prompt:
c++ -o Reservation_main.cpp
Run the compiled program by executing the generated executable file. You can do this by entering the following command in the terminal:
./Reservation_main.cpp
Input information as promted by the program after compilation and press enter.
Terminate or EXIT the program by entering 0 in the main menu.  

**Features of the program**

This program allows passengers to choose the following things from the menu:
Customers can reserve a seat.
customers can cancel their reservation.
Customers can search for their reservation through their ID.
Customers can request a meal and/or change the meal.
Customers can check in for the flight. 
A report can be printed for the total number of each meal(s) reserved. 
A report cna be printed to show all the passengers who have checked in and the count of the number of passengers who have not checked in.  

**Limitations**

The program does not handle payment processing or financial transactions.
The program does not consider any extra fees or taxes while booking or canceling a reservation.
The program does not provide any real-time connectivity with the airlines or the airport systems.

**Hardware and Software Requirements To Run Calculator Code**

Hardware Requirements:
A computer or device capable of running an operating system that supports C++ development.
Adequate RAM and storage space to compile and run C++ programs efficiently.
A keyboard and mouse or input device for interacting with the code editor and compiler.
A display monitor or screen to view the code, compiler output, and program execution.

Software Requirements:
An operating system that supports C++(20) development, such as Windows, macOS, or Linux.
A C++ compiler, such as g++, clang, or Visual C++, installed on your system to compile C++ code into executable programs.
An integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor for writing and editing C++ code, such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or Xcode.
Libraries or dependencies required for specific C++ programs, if any.
Optional: Version control software like Git for managing code changes and collaboration with others.
